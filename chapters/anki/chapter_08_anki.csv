Basic	BoW limitation?	Ignores word order	chapter08::bag-of-words
Basic	What is term frequency (tf)?	Count of word in document	chapter08::term-frequency
Basic	What is TF-IDF?	Term Frequency × Inverse Document Frequency	chapter08::tfidf

Basic	How does out-of-core work?	Process mini-batches incrementally	chapter08::out-of-core
Basic	Why can't CountVectorizer do out-of-core?	Needs full vocabulary in memory	chapter08::out-of-core
Basic	What is the hashing trick?	Hash words directly to indices	chapter08::out-of-core
Basic	Hashing trick tradeoff?	More features = fewer collisions but more memory	chapter08::out-of-core
